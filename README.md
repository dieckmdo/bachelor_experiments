# bachelor_experiments

This repository contains the scripts, data and results of the experiments conducted for my bachelor thesis.

## Folder Structure 

Each experiment can be found in a seperate folder at the highest level. 

Folders starting with *Classifier* contain experiments using a classifier for classification.

The other folders are stating the Train - and Testset and which groundtruth was used. Train - and Testsets can either be *Unreal* or *Real* data. GT can be *Class* classification or *Instance* classification.
